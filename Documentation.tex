A program that takes in user-input coefficients for a 3-polynomial non-linear equation and performs the bisection method to solve for the roots of the equation within a user-defined tolerance level. 

The bisection method involves iteratively dividing the interval containing the root into two halves until the interval becomes smaller than the desired tolerance level. 

The program outputs the root of the equation, the number of iterations required to find the root, and the final interval size.

Useful tool for solving non-linear equations numerically, particularly when analytical methods are not possible.
